# Config

This is a basic checklist for the system prefernces that makes my macOS experience just a tad bit better.

Most of the customizations were taken from (https://github.com/mdo/config)

## Checklist

### Prep OS X

* Install `xcode` command line tools using `xcode-select --install`

* Use the following command to run the `config.sh` file in Terminal

```zsh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exkcd/config/main/config.sh > ~/Downloads/config.sh && zsh ~/Downloads/config.sh
```

### Homebrew formulae and casks

The following list contains all of the Homebrew formulae and casks that I have installed to help with version control, university studies, and other miscellaneous things.

1. `brew install python`
2. `brew install --cask gimp`
3. `brew install vim`
4. `brew install gh`
5. `brew install git`

## Usage

It works for me, but if it doesn't work for you, that's a you problem, and I'm sorry.
